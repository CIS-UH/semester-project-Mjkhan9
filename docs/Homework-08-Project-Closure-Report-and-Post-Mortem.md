Homework 8 – Part 1: Project Closure Report

Executive Summary

This semester, I worked with Software Corp on a Stocks & Bonds Tracker for individual investors. The whole idea was to keep things simple, let people record stocks and bonds, manage a watchlist, and see clear, honest summaries. We stuck to the basics and made sure it was something you could actually use.

Looking back, we really did build a working web prototype. It was single-user only, no trading or fancy extras, but you could add, edit, and keep track of your holdings with a summary view. Having our code in GitHub and setting up a CI/CD pipeline honestly took a lot of pressure off. Updates weren’t a nightmare, and version control kept things clean. Keeping our scope tight was the smartest call; it saved us from endless changes and re-work.

Achievements and Shortfalls

Going through the original plan (especially the Gantt chart from Homework 2), I’m happy with how much we actually accomplished: repo and folder setup, watchlist design, clean stock and bond models, and working CSV import/export. Breaking everything into steps with a Work Breakdown Structure made it manageable, even for someone new to this.

Here’s what worked: the UI was simple, adding and editing records was easy, summary totals stayed accurate, and data flowed smoothly in and out. The watchlist search worked as planned. Using GitHub and CI/CD saved us hours compared to manual updates.

Still, not everything made it in. Charts and deeper analytics had to be cut, too much effort for the time we had. Testing slowed us down since most of it was manual, and our automation never got finished. Some documentation lagged behind, but daily stand-ups helped us catch up. Buffer days from our Risk Register (Homework 4) turned out to be a lifesaver; if something ran long, we adjusted without panic.

Lessons Learned

Consistent communication was the biggest win. Daily stand-ups actually worked, and weekly sprint reviews kept everyone clear on progress. The Risk Register meant nothing slipped too far. Estimating hours was tougher than expected, we started at 560 for the team, but late nights fixing CI/CD issues pushed that higher.

Sprints and the Trello board (Homework 3) helped keep things focused, and sponsor feedback guided our priorities. If I’m honest, I’d start automated pipelines earlier next time; leaving them for the end caused stress. Even small habits, like updating notes and Notion logs, kept everyone aligned and reduced confusion.

Here’s a simple truth: getting the basics right matters more than stacking on features. If it works, users are happy. Peer reviews and quick check-ins (Homework 7) boosted morale, even if it meant a few extra meetings.

Recommendations for Future Projects

If I did this again, CI/CD would be one of the first setups after creating the repo. Adding simple visuals like charts would make summaries more useful, so I’d push those earlier. I’d also start tracking sprint hours from week one, it makes estimates a lot more honest by mid-semester.

Short retrospectives after each sprint work better than one big post-mortem later. Quick feedback loops catch issues early. In plain terms, the main tracker was practical and usable, but adding analytics, multi-user support, and a formal acceptance checklist would make future versions much stronger.

Tying it back to class, the CIS stakeholder grid and risk matrix really helped organize updates and decisions, while buffer days kept the schedule realistic.
Overall, doing this project showed me that real project management isn’t just about planning, it’s about staying clear, communicating, and adjusting as things change.
