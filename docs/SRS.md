Purpose  
The purpose of this project is to create a simple program that lets new investors add stock holdings and view a summary. Bonds and reports will be added later.

FR3: Later assignments will include a bond with a par and coupon.  
FR4 Later assignments will generate a plain-text report.  

Non-Functional Requirements  
NFR1 The code must be clear and easy to read.  
NFR2 The program must handle invalid inputs without crashing.  
NFR3 The program must run in Python 3 without external packages.
