Homework 2 Step 1 Assumptions and Estimation Approach  
The project is called Investment Portfolio Application. The program will run on a local machine with Python 3 installed. No external libraries or APIs will be used in this homework. The estimation method is based on person hours with a twenty five percent contingency for tasks that are new to me. Durations are divided into two hour blocks on weekdays.  

Homework 2 Step 2 Work Breakdown Structure  
The initiation and requirements phase includes reviewing the slides and instructions, collecting and refining user stories, and defining the scope and constraints.  
The design phase includes making the data model for positions and defining the function interfaces.  
The implementation phase includes coding add stock, add bond, make summary, make text report, and writing a demo in the main function.  
The validation and testing phase includes running manual tests for valid inputs, running manual tests for invalid inputs, and saving a sample run with output.  
The documentation phase includes updating the README with run steps, updating the SRS with functional and non functional requirements, and updating the Week 1 log.  
The project management phase includes schedule tracking, adjustments, and packaging the project for submission.  

Homework 2 Step 3 Activity List with Estimated Hours  
Reviewing slides and assignment takes three hours.  
Finalizing user stories and acceptance criteria takes three hours.  
Writing scope and constraints takes one hour.  
Designing the data model takes one hour.  
Planning function signatures takes one hour.  
Coding add stock takes one hour.  
Coding add bond takes one and a half hours.  
Coding make summary takes one hour.  
Coding make text report takes one hour.  
Writing the demo takes half an hour.  
Running valid input tests takes one hour.  
Running invalid input tests takes one hour.  
Saving a sample run and output takes half an hour.  
Updating the README takes one hour.  
Updating the SRS takes one hour.  
Updating the Week 1 notes takes half an hour.  
Checking the schedule and buffer takes one hour.  
Packaging the final submission takes half an hour.  
The total estimated effort is nineteen and a half hours.  

Homework 2 Step 4 Dependencies  
Finalizing stories depends on reviewing the slides.  
Writing scope depends on completing stories.  
Designing the data model depends on stories and scope.  
Planning functions depends on the data model.  
Coding functions depends on planning.  
Testing depends on completing the demo.  
Documentation depends on finishing the tests.  
Final schedule check depends on documentation.  
Packaging depends on schedule checks.  

Homework 2 Step 5 Milestones  
Requirements are approved after stories and scope are complete.  
Core functions are complete after the text report is coded.  
The demo is complete after the program runs with example data.  
Testing is complete after running valid and invalid inputs.  
Documentation is complete after updating the README, the SRS, and the weekly log.  
The project is ready for submission after packaging is complete.  

Daily Tasks and Hours

- Day 1: Review slides and begin writing user stories - 3.0 hours
  
- Day 2: Complete user stories, write the project scope, and design the model - 3.0 hours
  
- Day 3: Plan function signatures and code to add stock - 2.0 hours
  
- Day 4: Code the functionality to add bonds and create a summary - 2.5 hours
  
- Day 5: Develop a text report and prepare for the demo - 1.5 hours
  
- Day 6: Conduct tests using valid and invalid input - 2.0 hours
  
- Day 7: Save a sample run and update the README file - 1.5 hours
  
- Day 8: Update the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) and weekly log - 1.5 hours
  
- Day 9: Check the project schedule and prepare for submission packaging - 1.5 hours

- Buffer: Buffer time allocated between Days 6 and 9 - 1.0 hour 

Homework 2 Step 7 Risk Register  
Risk one is underestimating coding time, which may cause incomplete functions. The response is to use the buffer and reduce optional formatting.  
Risk two is confusion with acceptance tests, which may lead to rework. The response is to review stories with class notes before coding.  
Risk three is version issues with Python, which may cause delays in work. The response is to test on lab machines and avoid external packages.  
Risk four is last-minute errors, which may lower submission quality. The response is to finish one day early and use the buffer to fix errors.  

Homework 2 Step 8 Sample Code Snippets  
The add stock function checks that the ticker is not empty and the quantity is positive. If valid, the ticker is saved in uppercase, and the quantity is stored as a float.  
The add bond function checks that the ticker is not empty, the quantity and par are positive, and the coupon is non-negative. If valid, the bond is saved in uppercase with numeric fields stored as floats.  
The make summary function counts total items, stocks, and bonds, and returns these counts with the positions.  
The make text report function prints a header and then lists the holdings. If the portfolio is empty, it prints empty. If the portfolio contains items, it lists each stock and bond, providing details.  
The demo script adds two stocks and one bond, then prints the summary and the text report.  

Homework 2 Step 9 Submission Checklist  
My name is Mohammad Khan, and my ID 2245764 is included at the top of the documents. The SRS is updated with requirements and user stories. The README is updated with run steps. The Week 1 notes are updated with what was delivered. The program runs in Python 3 and prints both a summary and a report.
