This week I completed Homework 8, which covered Project Closure and the Post-Mortem report. I finalized the Project Closure Report for the Stocks & Bonds Tracker, summarizing the project’s results, achievements, lessons learned, and future recommendations. I also wrote a Post-Mortem analysis on the 2017 Equifax Data Breach to compare real-world risk management failures with my project’s practices.
