Homework 1: Project Initiation - Vision, Scope, and Requirements

1.1 Project Acquisition and Vision
Software Corp was chosen because we have a proven track record of creating small, reliable finance tools. Our goal is to build a straightforward Stocks and Bonds tracker that is easy to use and simple to maintain. We will keep the work focused and avoid scope growth. This tracker is for individual investors who want a clear way to monitor their holdings.

1.2 Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

Purpose
State what the product will do and what is included in the first release. This document guides design, development, testing, and acceptance.

Scope
A web-based tracker for one user. The user records stocks and bonds, manages a watchlist, and views basic summaries. No trading. No advice.

Overall Description
The target user is an individual investor. The app shows simple forms and tables. It stores data and keeps it consistent. A short help page explains each field.

Constraints
Keep the feature set small in the first release. Favor clarity over complexity. Use common, well-understood patterns.

Assumptions
This is a class project. The priority is a clean scope, working features, and a straightforward handoff.
