Overview  
This project is the first step in a semester-long assignment. The objective is to develop a straightforward tool for tracking a small investment portfolio. This phase, Homework 1, focuses on adding stock positions and printing a summary. Future assignments will include bonds, a text report, and basic pricing features.

Files Included  
- The file docs/SRS.md contains the Software Requirements Specification.  
- The file src/portfolio.py contains the Python code.  
- The files weekly_logs/Week-01.md and weekly_logs/Week-02.md contain weekly notes and planning updates.

How to Run  
Ensure that Python 3 is installed. Open a terminal in the project folder and run the command `python3 src/portfolio.py`. The program will print a dictionary summary with totals and then display a plain text report.

What I Completed  
I set up the repository folders: docs, src, and weekly_logs. I wrote the Software Requirements Specification (SRS). I implemented the functionality to add stocks and generate a summary. I tested the program with AAPL and MSFT stocks and confirmed that the output is correct.
