Overview
This is my Homework 1 for the semester project. I set up the repo, wrote a short SRS, and made a small Python file that can add a stock and print a simple summary.

What’s in here
- docs/SRS.md — short write-up with goal, a few requirements, and one use case
- src/portfolio.py — small script with add_stock and make_summary
- weekly-logs/Week-01.md — quick notes on what I planned/did/next

How to run the demo
1) Make sure Python 3 is on your machine.
2) From the repo folder, run:
   python3 src/portfolio.py
3) It should print a dictionary showing two stocks (AAPL, MSFT) and totals.

What I did this week
- Created the folders and files
- Wrote a short SRS draft
- Coded add_stock() and make_summary(), and tested with two example tickers

What’s next
- Add bonds support
- Make a simple text report
- Later: think about price lookups
